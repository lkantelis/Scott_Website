        <h2>An Overview of my Career</h2>
        <p>I began my IT career by enrolling in the Cisco Networking Academy through the Carroll County Career and Technology Center. There, I was able to gain hands on experience with Cisco equipment in a simulation lab and practice skills such as subnetting, implementing IPv4 and IPv6 address schemes, and switch and router configuration. Through the Cisco Networking Academy, I earned my CCENT â€“ Cisco Certified Entry Level Technician.</p>
        <p>Now I am sophomore at Towson University working towards a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology. My course work includes computer networking, database administration, programming, and security. I am also a member of the Technology Club and Cyber Defense Club where I am able to gain the practical knowledge needed for network security engineering. Topics covered include industry certifications, offensive security, defensive tactics. These clubs allow me to give presentations on security topics such as key-based authentication and the Metasploit Framework.</p>
        <p>Along with my experience in college, I have an internship with Aplura, LLC working as a System Administrator. A typical day at the office includes configuring Splunk forwarders, BareOS/Bacula clients, Infoblox DNS, and security research. These tasks allow me to work with a variety of software (which helped me learn Linux). As time goes on, I am gaining greater proficiency which has opened up opportunities to train coworkers. Aplura offers a great learning environment where I am pushed to grow and develop my skills as an IT professional.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I work towards studying for certifications to prepare for my career in information security. Over the past year of working with Aplura, through self-studying and the help of my supportive coworkers, I was able to pass the Red Hat Certified System Administrator certification. I am now studying for the Security+ exam to learn more about the fundamentals of IT security. In the future I plan on obtaining the RHCE - Red Hat Certified Engineer - and CISSP - Certified Information Systems Security Professional.
