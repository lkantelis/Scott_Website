        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I began my IT career by enrolling in the Cisco Networking Academy through the Carroll County Career and Technology Center. There, I was able to have hands on experience with Cisco equipment in a simulation lab and practice skills such as subnetting, implementing IPv4 and IPv6 address schemes, and switch and router configuration. Through the Cisco Networking Academy, I earned my CCENT â€“ Cisco Certified Entry Level Technician.</p>
        <p>Now I am attending Towson University for a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology. My course work includes computer networking, database administration, and programming. I am also a member of the Technology Club and Cyber Defense Club where I am able to gain the practical knowledge needed for network security engineering. Topics covered include industry certifications, offensive security, and using Linux.</p>
        <p>Along with my experience in college, I have an internship with Aplura, LLC working as a System Administrator. My responsibilities include server maintenance, IP management, and hardware installation. Most of my work involves Linux, and I am preparing to take my Red Hat certification.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I work towards certifications to prepare for my career in information security. I am working on my Red Hat Certified System Administrator certification now and plan on getting my Red Hat Certified Engineer certification. Over the upcoming summer, I plan on completing the Cisco Certified Network Associate Certification. Finally, I want to complete my Security+ and Certified Ethical Hacking certifications before I graduate from college.</p>
