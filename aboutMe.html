        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My hometown, Westminster, MD, is not exactly the hub for technology. Typical Carroll County, Maryland activities included hunting, farming, and tractor driving. As you can imagine, there is little advanced technology in a place like Westminster. </p>
        <p>At first I did not expect to enter the IT field. In high school, I excelled at the French Horn and planned to become a music performer for a symphony. I made the Maryland All-State Orchestra three years in a row and was the highest ranked performer in two of those years. This accomplishment allowed me to performance with the All-Eastern Orchestra and All-National Band which held some of the best musicians from around the country. Since I am not currently majoring in music, I participate in Towson University’s Symphonic Band for pure enjoyment.</p>
        <p>Along with music, I enjoy playing soccer. I’ve played soccer since I was in elementary school and was captain of my high school team. Since I don’t have the time now to continue playing soccer, I simply watch it when I get the chance.</p>
        <p>Even though music and soccer are my hobbies, they can be a little stressful at times. However, my greatest relaxation is snowboarding. I have snowboarded up in the North East region and will be going out West to Colorado in the Spring. This is definitely my way of keeping calm when life gets a little stressful, so I look forward to the Winter every year.</p>
